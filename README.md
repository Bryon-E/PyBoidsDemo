# PyBoidsDemo
 Small proof-of-concept project to deepen my knowledge of boids. 

This project was a studying project for me to understand the implementation of boids. Currently, all variables controlling boid rules are constants. 
Left clicking creates a fixation for the boids to prioritize focusing on. Right clicking destroys a fixation or does nothing if there are none.
